**Portfolio Optimization

Stage: Problem Framing & Scoping (Stage 01)

Problem Statement

Investors and portfolio managers face the challenge of allocating capital efficiently across multiple financial assets to maximize returns while controlling for risk. Traditional optimization methods, such as mean-variance optimization, often fail to capture complex market dynamics and interdependencies among assets.

This project aims to leverage deep learning and advanced data analytics to improve portfolio optimization by:

Predicting stock returns

Constructing portfolios with higher risk-adjusted performance

The insights generated will help investors make more informed allocation decisions, especially in volatile markets.

Stakeholder & User

Primary Stakeholders:

Portfolio managers

Quantitative analysts

Individual investors

User Needs:

Actionable recommendations for asset allocation decisions

Outputs integrated into existing workflows

Reports updated at regular intervals (e.g., weekly or monthly)

Useful Answer & Decision

Type: Predictive and actionable

Outputs Include:

Forecasts of stock returns

Feature importance highlighting key drivers of returns

Optimized portfolio weights

Deliverables:

Metrics: expected return, volatility, Sharpe ratio

Artifacts: portfolio allocation tables, visual dashboards

Assumptions & Constraints

Historical stock data is available via Yahoo Finance and other public sources

Macroeconomic indicators (e.g., interest rates, VIX) are relevant and accessible

Computation limited to personal workstation/GPU

Market behavior may shift, requiring continuous model retraining

Known Unknowns / Risks

Model overfitting or poor performance during extreme market events

Availability and quality of data for all target stocks

Changes in economic regimes affecting predictive relationships

Monitoring and testing via backtesting and performance evaluation
