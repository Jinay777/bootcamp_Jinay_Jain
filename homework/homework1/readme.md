Project Title
Portfolio Optimization

Problem Statement

Investors and portfolio managers face the challenge of allocating capital efficiently across multiple financial assets to maximize returns while controlling for risk. Traditional optimization methods, like mean-variance optimization, often fail to capture complex market dynamics and interdependencies among assets. This project aims to leverage deep learning and advanced data analytics to improve portfolio optimization by predicting stock returns and constructing portfolios with higher risk-adjusted performance. The insights generated can help investors make more informed allocation decisions in volatile markets.

Stakeholder & User

The primary stakeholders are portfolio managers, quantitative analysts, and individual investors seeking systematic approaches to portfolio construction. Users require actionable recommendations for asset allocation decisions, ideally integrated into their existing investment workflow, with outputs accessible at regular intervals (e.g., weekly or monthly).

Useful Answer & Decision

The desired output is predictive and actionable: forecasts of stock returns, feature importance for drivers of returns, and optimized portfolio weights. The deliverable will be a combination of metrics (expected return, volatility, Sharpe ratio) and artifacts (portfolio allocation table, visual dashboards).

Assumptions & Constraints

Historical stock data is accessible via Yahoo Finance and other public sources.

Macroeconomic indicators (e.g., interest rates, VIX) are available and relevant.

Computation resources are limited to personal workstation/GPU access.

Market behavior may shift, requiring continuous model retraining.

Known Unknowns / Risks

Model overfitting or underperformance during extreme market events.

Availability of accurate and clean data for all target stocks.

Changes in economic regimes that alter predictive relationships.

Testing assumptions via backtesting and performance monitoring.
