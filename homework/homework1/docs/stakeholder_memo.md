# Stakeholder Memo: Portfolio Optimization Project

**To:** Portfolio Managers, Quantitative Analysts, Individual Investors  
**From:** Jinay Jain  
**Date:** [Insert Date]  
**Subject:** Project Framing & Goals â€” Portfolio Optimization Using Deep Learning

---

## Project Overview

Investors face the challenge of allocating capital efficiently across multiple financial assets to maximize returns while managing risk. Traditional methods like mean-variance optimization often fail to capture complex market dynamics and interdependencies among assets. Our project aims to leverage deep learning and advanced data analytics to improve portfolio optimization by predicting stock returns and constructing portfolios with higher risk-adjusted performance.

## Stakeholders & Users

- **Primary Stakeholders:** Portfolio managers and quantitative analysts who make investment decisions.  
- **End Users:** Individual investors seeking systematic, data-driven portfolio recommendations.  
- **Workflow Context:** Users will access portfolio insights on a regular cadence (e.g., weekly or monthly) to guide allocation decisions.

## Useful Answers & Deliverables

- **Predictive Outputs:** Forecasts of individual stock returns and drivers of performance (feature importance).  
- **Artifacts:** Optimized portfolio weights, allocation tables, and visual dashboards.  
- **Metrics:** Expected return, portfolio volatility, Sharpe ratio, and risk-adjusted performance indicators.

## Assumptions & Constraints

- Historical stock data is available from Yahoo Finance or other public sources.  
- Macroeconomic indicators (e.g., interest rates, VIX) are accessible and relevant.  
- Computation is limited to personal workstation or GPU resources.  
- Market behavior may shift; continuous model retraining is required.

## Known Unknowns / Risks

- Model may underperform in extreme market conditions.  
- Data accuracy or completeness may be an issue for certain stocks.  
- Economic regime changes could alter predictive relationships.  
- Risks will be monitored via backtesting and model performance tracking.
