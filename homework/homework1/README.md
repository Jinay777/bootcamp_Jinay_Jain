# Portfolio Optimization
**Stage:** Problem Framing & Scoping (Stage 01)

---

## Problem Statement
Investors and portfolio managers face the challenge of allocating capital efficiently across multiple financial assets to maximize returns while controlling for risk. Traditional optimization methods, such as mean-variance optimization, often fail to capture complex market dynamics and interdependencies among assets.

This project leverages **deep learning** and **advanced analytics** to:
- Predict stock returns
- Construct portfolios with higher risk-adjusted performance

The outputs help investors make informed allocation decisions, especially during volatile market conditions.

## Stakeholder & User
**Primary Stakeholders:**
- Portfolio managers
- Quantitative analysts
- Individual investors

**User Needs:**
- Actionable recommendations for asset allocation
- Integration into existing workflows
- Regular updates (weekly/monthly)

---

## Useful Answer & Decision
- **Type:** Predictive and actionable
- **Outputs Include:**
  - Forecasts of stock returns
  - Feature importance of return drivers
  - Optimized portfolio weights
- **Deliverables:**
  - Metrics: expected return, volatility, Sharpe ratio
  - Artifacts: portfolio allocation tables, visual dashboards

---

## Assumptions & Constraints
- Historical stock data is available via Yahoo Finance
- Relevant macroeconomic indicators (e.g., interest rates, VIX) are accessible
- Computation limited to personal workstation/GPU
- Market behavior may shift, requiring model retraining

---

## Known Unknowns / Risks
- Model overfitting or poor performance in extreme market events
- Accuracy and completeness of stock data
- Changes in economic regimes affecting predictive relationships
- Monitoring and testing via backtesting and performance evaluation
